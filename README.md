# Cyber-Punk-Trainer

Hey all!
I just wanted to cover a few tidbits, in regards to The Cyberpunk Trainer.  
See the YouTube link below if you'd like some supplemental documentation.

The software only really takes 1 or 2 steps to install.  Simply download the .zip file, click on the **Installer** file,
and go through the prompts.  

Source code exists here on GitHub, and anyone out there who would like to collaborate, or trade some knowledge, I'm passionate about growing 
as a Developer.

*Notes*
The memory pointers I'm using are expressed as strings, if you would like to use them in CheatEngine, or anything along those lines.
If you have trouble running the program, make sure you run it in Administrator mode, and check to make sure the x64 version installed (it should be by default).
There shouldn't be any other add-ons to install.  Just make sure you are running the latest version of .NET.

If you run into any other issues, feel free to message me on Discord @ Howzit Kiffen (Sekts AndKandy)#4146
